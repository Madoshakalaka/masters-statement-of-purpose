    Hi, People at King's College London!

    My name is Siyuan Yan,
    and I preferred the name Matt to avoid unnecessary tongue-twisting.
    I have broad interests in math and computer science.
    I code both as a hobby and in work, and I'm a contributor and creator of numerous projects
    \footnote{My GitHub page: \url{https://github.com/Madoshakalaka}}.

    In the meantime, I'm fascinated by the interaction between computer science and mathematics,
    the major areas being numerical methods, combinatorics, and theorem provers.

    I acknowledge I have a lacking GPA of 2.81/4.0, yet I don't think it's a faithful reflection of my ability.
    I'll explain the extraneous situation I went through below,
    and It's my sincere wish that my all around skills and strong research interest be considered.

    With all the excitements I have,
    I crave an opportunity to study at King's before I can contribute to the academia.
    I have a close friend currently studying at King's,
    and I've heard nice things from them about their vibrant college life.
    It's my sincerest hope that I could join them in the upcoming Fall semester.
