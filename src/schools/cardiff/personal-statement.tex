    Hi, People at Cardiff University!

    My name is Siyuan Yan,
    and I preferred the name Matt to avoid unnecessary tongue-twisting.
    I have broad interests in math and computer science.
    I code both as a hobby and in work, and I'm a contributor and creator of numerous projects
    \footnote{My GitHub account: \url{https://github.com/Madoshakalaka}}.

    In the meantime, I'm fascinated by the interaction between computer science and mathematics,
    the major areas being numerical methods, combinatorics, and theorem provers.

    I acknowledge I have a lacking GPA of 2.81/4.0, yet I don't think it's a faithful reflection of my ability,
    as it's due to extraneous personal conditions in the year 2020.
    It's my sincere wish that my all around skills and strong research interest be considered.

    With all the excitement I have,
    I crave an opportunity to study more at Cardiff University before I can contribute to academia
    , and I look forward to a new chapter of my life in Cardiff in the upcoming fall term.
