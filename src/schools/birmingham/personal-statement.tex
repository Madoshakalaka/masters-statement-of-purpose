    Hi, People at the University of Birmingham!

    My name is Siyuan Yan,
    and I preferred the name Matt to avoid unnecessary tongue-twisting.
    I have broad interests in math and computer science.
    Coding and open-source has been my hobby since high school,
    in the meantime, doing academic research has always been my life goal.

    \input{../../fragments/research-interest-hott-and-proof-assist}

    With all the excitements I have,
    I crave an opportunity to study more about the relavant fields
    in the University of Birmingham before I can contribute to the research.
    During my search for ideal supervisors,
    I found Dr. Eric Finster \footnote{\url{https://ericfinster.github.io/}} in the University of Birmingham in the
    authors of \textit{the HoTT book}\footnote{\url{https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/}},
    I believe he can be an ideal mentor for my further studies,
    or at least, a person I can turn to in my path of graduate studies.

    I sincerely hope my application be thoroughly considered.
    Please feel free to ask any further questions via my email \href{mailto:syan4@ualberta.ca}{syan4@ualberta.ca}.
