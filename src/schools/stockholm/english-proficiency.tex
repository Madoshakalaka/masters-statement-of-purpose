    Hi, I received a notification regarding my TOEFL report.
    It's older than 2 years and can no longer be verified.
    I'm sorry that is the case,
    but in the meantime, I should have met the English language requirement.

    My undergraduate school, University of Alberta, is a reputable school in Canada.
    The admission to its undergraduate program for international students requires a TOEFL test score of at least 90 or a IELTS test score of at least 6.5.
    Details can be checked here: \href{https://www.ualberta.ca/admissions/international/admission/admission-requirements/language-requirements/index.html?}{University of Alberta, Language Requirements, International Students}.
    The city, Edmonton, where the university is in, is also an English-speaking area of Canada.

    I met the language requirement when I applied for University of Alberta,
    and I have taken and passed a total of 40 undergraduate courses to graduate, all taught in English.
    My undergraduate transcript as well as the recommendation letters from my professors should serve as a proof.

    Sorry for the inconvenience!
    Please feel free to send further inquiries if anything else is needed!
