Hi, I received an notification regarding my TOEFL report. It's is older than 2 years and can no longer be verified. I'm sorry that is the case. But in the meantime, I should have met the English language requirement.

My undergraduate school, University of Alberta, is a reputable school in Canada. The admission to its undergraduate program for international students require a TOEFL test score of at least 90 or a IELTS test score of at least 6.5. Details can be checked here: https://www.ualberta.ca/admissions/international/admission/admission-requirements/language-requirements/index.html? . All courses there are taught in English only too.

I met the language requirement when I applied for University of Alberta. And I have taken and passed a total of 40 undergraduate courses to graduate, all taught in English. My undergraduate transcript and recommendation letters from my professors should serve as a proof.

Sorry for the inconvinience! Please feel free to send further inquiries if anything else is needed!
