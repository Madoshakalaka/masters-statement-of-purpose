    \maketitle



    The degree requirement of my to-be-certified undergraduate program, \textit{Specialization in Mathematics},
    in the University of Alberta has a high concentration on mathematical courses.
    I'm also proud to have taken the Honors variant of most of the courses,
    which are more research oriented and focus more on the proofs instead of application.

    \section*{Undergraduate Courses}

    Here is a list of relevant courses in my undergraduate years.

    On the algebra side, I have taken and passed:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Math 127 Honors Linear Algebra I
        \item Math 227 Honors Linear Algebra II
        \item Math 328 Algebra Intro Group Theory
        \item Math 326 Rings and Modules
    \end{itemize}

    of which the latter two should satisfy the course requirements of Stockholm University.

    On the analysis side, I have taken and passed:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Math 117 Honors Calculus I
        \item Math 227 Honors Calculus II
        \item Math 217 Honors Advanced Calculus I
        \item Math 317 Honors Advanced Calculus II
        \item Math 331 Theory of Functions Complex Variable
        \item Math 411 Honors Complex Variables
        \item Math 417 Honors Real Variables
    \end{itemize}

    Other math courses I have taken and passed are:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Math 253 Theory of Interest
        \item Math 334 Intro into Differential Equations
        \item Math 373 Math Program/Optimization I
        \item Math 421 Combinatorics
    \end{itemize}

    \section*{Readings}

    In the past few months, I have been reading textbooks in my fields of interest.
    These include:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The HoTT Book \footnote{The book is about Homotopy Type Theory, see \url{https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/}}
        \item Mathematical Logic, Proofs and Their Limits \footnote{The book's Chinese name is 数理逻辑，证明及其限度, published by Fudan University}
        \item Set Theory, a Exploration of the Concept of Infinity\footnote{The book's Chinese name is 集合论，对无穷概念的探索, published by Fudan University}
    \end{itemize}
