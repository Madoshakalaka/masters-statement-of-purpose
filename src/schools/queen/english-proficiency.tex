    \maketitle

    My undergraduate school is The University of Alberta.
    The admission to its undergraduate program for international students requires a TOEFL test score of at least 90 or a IELTS test score of at least 6.5.
    Details can be checked here: \href{https://www.ualberta.ca/admissions/international/admission/admission-requirements/language-requirements/index.html?}{University of Alberta, Language Requirements, International Students}.
    As it's shown on the website: ``English is the primary language of instruction for all programs."

    The city, Edmonton, where the university is located in, is also an English-speaking area of Canada.

    I met the language requirement when I applied to The University of Alberta,
    and I have taken and passed a total of 40 undergraduate courses to graduate in a span of 5 years, all taught in English.
    My undergraduate transcript as well as the recommendation letters from my professors should serve as a proof.
