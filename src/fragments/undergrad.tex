\section*{Undergraduate Studies}

I began my undergraduate studies in a Computer Science Specialization Program with Math Minor.
From the outset, I took Honours equivalent of all the math requirements,
where courses are oriented towards proofs and methodology rather than applications.
As a payoff, I applied to and was admitted to the Honours program in my second year,
with math major and computer science minor.

Starting from 2019, while maintaining a full enrolment,
I worked as a research assistant in the linguistic department of the University of Alberta for 1.5 years during my undergraduate studies,
under the supervision of Dr. Antti Arppe, a computational linguist.
From the work experience,
I gained hands-on experience in assorted aspects of software development.

Academically, I had a hiccup in my fourth year,
when I tried to start an online service with applied machine learning
and diverted too much attention.
As a consequence,
I had to drop from the Honours program to a general science program.

I eventually fought back on track.
Finishing my last undergraduate course in the winter of 2021.
Considering my over-all GPA and advanced course selections,
rather than the current program listed on the transcript,
the school lets me graduate with a B.Sc. in Math Specialization,
which has stricter GAP requirements and course requirements.
I have requested proof statements from the school of the degree change,
yet the school says this won't show up on the transcript until June 2022,
when I will receive my official graduation certificate.
