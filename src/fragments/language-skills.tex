\section*{Language Skills}

An outstanding mastering of spoken English has been one of my proudest abilities,
thanks to my deep interest in phonetics and linguistics in general.
It's usual for others to mistake me for a native English speaker despite my Chinese upbringing.
I love learning new languages, making friends from all backgrounds, and I have kept deep connections with my friends in Canada and my past colleagues.
